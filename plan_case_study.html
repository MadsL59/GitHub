          <h2>Save Now to Experience Later</h2>
          <p>Saving money can be a tricky task to do, considering we live in a world where
            we are bombarded with ads every day but also when we are constrained by time.
            But what do you do when you need that extra cash to get what you want? Probably
            not what everyone would like to hear, but, YES, you start SAVING. Pen and paper
            are out of the question (hello 2021!).

            I wanted to make an app that comes to everyone’s rescue, an app that shows how
            much you spend and on what but also provides an insight into what you can do to
            cut costs and save money in a certain amount of time. Yes, there are a lot of apps
            like that out there, but not a lot are fun, engaging and reliable like PLAN.
          </p>
          <h2>My Role</h2>
          <p>My role as a UI/UX designer for this project involved doing user research,
            testing and a competitor analysis, user flow diagrams, wireframes, protyping
            and high-fidelity mock-ups as well as branding and visual design. This app was
            part of a UI Course I took from CareerFoundry, online.
          </p>
          <h2>Wish, Plan and Accomplish</h2>
          <p>You can take advantage of the Open Banking platform to safely retrieve information
            on your actual finances and get personalized advice on how to reach your savings goals.
            The world of Finance can be daunting for many of us who are less familiar with the industry,
            but PLAN's main goal is to be reliable, clear and to build confidence in all of its users.
            All data on income and expenses can be recorded easily and on the go on the app and it is
            accessible at all times with a viable internet connection.

        <!-- Challenge and Users Section -->
        <div class="container">
          <h2>Challenge accepted</h2>
          <p>With so many similar apps out there, the challenge was to create a fun and
            youthful app that would appeal to the majority of users but also that would
            add value in their lives. The Finance world can be scary and not everyone
            knows and understands the HOW TOs so the challenge was not to make ANOTHER
            money saving app but one that gets the attention of users and makes them come
            back and actually use it. So, mixing FUN with SAFETY and RELIABILITY was the
            real challenge when designing the app.

          <h2>Are you using the app?</h2>
          <p>PLAN would work for people who want to save money or find difficulty in saving
            money, people in their 20s with small income, people who want to make a big purchase
            in a limited amount of time. Is that YOU?

        <!-- Research Section -->
        <div class="container">
          <h2>Research</h2>
          <p>I started the process by downloading a lot of money saving apps to get a
            feel of what’s out there and what features these apps have. What did my
            competitor analysis found? I looked at Emma, Moneybox and Monzo and they
            provided valuable insight into what users would expect from this type of
            product and the main featurs my app should cover.Then, keeping in mind the
            prospective users and the fact that PLAN should be clear and straight-forward,
            I created potential USER STORIES followed by the final USER FLOW DIAGRAM using Whimsical.

          <h2>Wireframes</h2>
          <h3>Scenario</h3>
          <p>Alex wants to go travelling for a year and needs to start saving but he doesn’t
            know what the best approach is. He is looking for a fun app that is simple and
            does the most work for him and can tell him exactly what his financial situation
            is and what he can do to achieve his goal.

        <!-- Branding Section -->
        <div class="container">
          <h2>Branding</h2>
          <p>I was also responsible for branding, so I created brand guidelines and a
            logo for this project. I chose yellow and orange as the overall chromatic
            because both are happy colours and create good energy and a fun, relaxed vibe.
            The logo’s caligraphic style is meant to replicate the idea of writing down
            notes in a notebook, using pen and paper as if the user is taking notes of spendings,
            creating budgets and making plans.

          <h2>Testing and Results</h2>
          <p>After finishing with my high-fidelity wireframes, I created a prototype
            and tested it on 3 users based on given scenarios. The main issue that was
            raised was the Dashboard/Overview Screen.Testers said the screen is not clear
            enough, they didn’t know exactly how to access the spendings overview or categories,
            nor what the yellow button’s function was. Also, users pointed out that after reading
            the headline, they would be inclined to look at the graph to see how close they are to
            their goals but in fact, the graph was showing an overview of their expenditure. All
            these issues seemed to confuse all users that tested the app.

        <!-- Final Section -->
        <div class="container">
          <h2>Retrospect</h2>
          <p>I am really happy with the final result and how the app looks like including
            the colour palette, illustrations and overall vibe. The project was reviewed
            by my peers, my tutor and mentor and I received very good feedback which was
            overall about how I successfully managed to make a moneysaving/fintech app
            look exciting and not plain and boring as most apps on the market.</p>
          <p>In terms of what didn’t go well, the project was done in a short period of time
            which meant less testing on users in the early stages. Also, because I wanted the
            app to be simple and not to overcomplicate features, the early design stages were
            a bit difficult too in terms of visuals which led to having a creative block.
            Furthermore, not thinking about overboarding screens or just coach marks to tell
            users how to use the app was a big disadvantage and the problem was spotted by all
            users that tested the final prototype.</p>
          <p>What I would improve? Allowing more time to do usability testing and a more comprehensive
            competitor analysis to enhance the features of the app and the overall experience. I would
            also explore more screens, and any other smart ways of using the app as well as focus on
            onboarding to faciliate and to make the user journey easier and more practical.</p>
